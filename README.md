This repository contains .pde code for Processing sketches (refer http://processing.org/ for more information on Processing).

These sketches are examples that have been developed over the years. Most make use of nature-inspired phenomena or mathematics, such as autonomous agents and cellular automata.

Although these sketches were originally developed in earlier versions of Processing, they were made to be compatible with Processing 3.
