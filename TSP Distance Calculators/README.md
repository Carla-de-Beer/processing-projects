Travelling Salesman Problem: Distance Calculator
================================================

This project demonstrates how a genetic algorithm can be used to find an optimised solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem.
The sketch dynamically reads in city data from a file and calculates the shortest distance it can find, linking all cities.
The actual physical distance on the route, calculated as the Haversine distance, is also shown.
Specifiable parameters: crossover rate, mutation rate, population size, max. no. iterations, elitism generation gap.

Resources: 
* City data obtained from: https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29
* The crossover strategy makes use of Modified Order Crossover (MOX), as described in:
